I’ve had a concept brewing in the background for a while, I felt somewhat constrained by Google Sites. 

Fast forward to an article I stumbled across about a talented man from the UK (Nick Hayes- The Last DJ ) who produces minimalist, industrial techno in a very stripped-down style. I, too, have a love for techno and electronic music, and reading about his approach totally reignited my desire to try something similar—perhaps using a DAW-less setup or my existing Ableton laptop setup. Either way, the idea emerged to showcase this on my own website.

So, after a few evenings, I had built a simple site from scratch, hosted on GitHub Pages. With the help of some code snippets, advice from ChatGPT, and a minimal theme reference from 2020, I managed to piece it together. 

Though initially I tried adapting a full theme  (Dean Attali -Beautiful Jekyll), I found it better to simplify it to match my vision. The site’s design is minimal, with a basic animation for the logo that I liked, and it’s built around SoundCloud embeds and my playlists to showcase my own music and current musical influences.

Turns out, SoundCloud allows me to embed my own music, so I’ll go with that approach for now. Along the way, I learned countless details about building and tweaking the site. It may not be the most polished solution yet, but it has the essentials: pictures, posts, HTML animations, colors, and GitHub’s HTTPS support. 

I’m sure I’ll be making plenty of tweaks, and I’m not entirely sure how well adding posts directly to the index will work long-term. But I’m excited to try it out and happy to break out of the Google Sites ecosystem, even though I appreciate its ease of use for quick project updates like this.

Anyway, take a look and enjoy!
